// ai-service-new.ts
// Deprecated/experimental variant of the AI service.
// The production implementation now lives in `src/lib/ai-service.ts` which includes a safe
// local responder fallback for development and a richer system prompt when Bedrock is used.

// This file is intentionally left as a placeholder to avoid confusion. If you want to
// permanently remove it, delete this file. For now it remains only as documentation.
