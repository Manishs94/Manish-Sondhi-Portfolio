  faq: [
    {
      question: "What is your approach to AI integration in UX design?",
      answer: "I focus on creating intuitive, ethical AI interactions while maintaining user trust and transparency. This includes implementing AWS Bedrock for research synthesis, designing conversational interfaces, and ensuring AI-driven features enhance rather than complicate the user experience. Key principles include: (1) Human-in-the-loop design where AI assists rather than replaces human judgment, (2) Explainable AI where users understand how AI recommendations are made, (3) Ethical guardrails to prevent bias and ensure fairness, (4) Clear fallback mechanisms when AI confidence is low."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle complex financial workflows?",
      answer: "I break down complex processes into intuitive, progressive steps using several strategies: (1) Progressive Disclosure - showing only relevant information at each step, (2) Visual Hierarchy - making important actions prominent, (3) Real-time Validation - providing immediate feedback on errors, (4) Context-Aware Guidance - offering help tailored to user needs. My work at CYNC Software demonstrates this through simplified loan management and collateral tracking systems that improved user efficiency by 25%. At Bank of America, the Bill Payment redesign reduced user error rates by 20% through these methodologies."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your experience with accessibility?",
      answer: "I'm WCAG 2.2 certified and ensure all designs meet accessibility standards. This includes: (1) Proper contrast ratios meeting AAA standards, (2) Full keyboard navigation support, (3) Screen reader compatibility and semantic HTML, (4) Alternative text for all images, (5) Accessible forms and input methods. At Bank of America, I led a WCAG 2.1 compliance audit and reduced accessibility violations by 95%. I also conduct user testing with people using assistive technologies to validate real-world accessibility."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you measure the success of your designs?",
      answer: "I use a combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback: Quantitative: User engagement rates, task completion rates, error rates, adoption metrics, session duration. Qualitative: User feedback from testing, stakeholder satisfaction, support ticket volume. Example metrics from my work: At CYNC, tracked 20% increase in user engagement and 25% reduction in onboarding time. At Bank of America, achieved 25% adoption increase for Bill Payment and improved app rating from 3.8 to 4.6 stars."
